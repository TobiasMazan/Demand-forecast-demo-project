# Demand-forecast-demo-project

__1. Project overview__

Public bicycle sharing (PBS) systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bicycle from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis.

In this demo exercise purpose has been to predict demand for PBS system services in Washington, D.C depending on meteorological data.
Of particular interest has been identification of conditions in which traffic would be low enough and weather mild enough to allow for PBS system maintenance.
